# Customization Guide

## Profile (config/profile.yml)

This is the single source of truth for your identity. All modes read from here.

Key sections:
- **candidate**: Name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, portfolio
- **target_roles**: Your North Star roles and archetypes
- **narrative**: Your headline, exit story, superpowers, proof points
- **compensation**: Target range, minimum, currency
- **location**: Country, timezone, visa status, on-site availability

## Target Roles (modes/_profile.md)

The archetype table in `_profile.md` determines how offers are scored and CVs are framed. Edit the table to match YOUR career targets:

```markdown
| Archetype | Thematic axes | What they buy |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Your Role 1** | key skills | what they need |
| **Your Role 2** | key skills | what they need |
```

Also update the "Adaptive Framing" table to map YOUR specific projects to each archetype.

## Portals (portals.yml)

Copy from `templates/portals.example.yml` and customize:

1. **title_filter.positive**: Keywords matching your target roles
2. **title_filter.negative**: Tech stacks or domains to exclude
3. **search_queries**: WebSearch queries for job boards (Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever)
4. **tracked_companies**: Companies to check directly

### Aggregator providers

Beyond ATS-direct scanning (Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever), two aggregator providers cover the long tail of companies that don't use those three ATSes:

- **adzuna** — public Jobs API aggregating SEEK / Indeed / LinkedIn / employer feeds. Useful for non-US markets (AU enterprises, EU mid-market) where ATS-direct scanners come up short. Free 1000 req/month tier from [developer.adzuna.com](https://developer.adzuna.com). Set `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` in `.env`.
- **linkedin-guest** — public LinkedIn guest-search endpoint, no auth. Aggressive rate-limits. **Private-fork-only** — don't PR upstream.

Each aggregator entry in `tracked_companies` represents one saved search, not a company. See the commented examples at the top of `tracked_companies` in `portals.example.yml`.

## CV Template (templates/cv-template.html)

The HTML template uses these design tokens:
- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk (headings) + DM Sans (body) -- self-hosted in `fonts/`
- **Colors**: Cyan primary (`hsl(187,74%,32%)`) + Purple accent (`hsl(270,70%,45%)`)
- **Layout**: Single-column, ATS-optimized

To customize fonts/colors, edit the CSS in the template. Update font files in `fonts/` if switching fonts.

## Negotiation Scripts (modes/_shared.md)

The negotiation section provides frameworks for salary discussions. Replace the example scripts with your own:
- Target ranges
- Geographic arbitrage strategy
- Pushback responses

## Hooks (Optional)

Career-ops can integrate with external systems via Claude Code hooks. Example hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'Career-ops session started'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Save hooks in `.claude/settings.json`.

## States (templates/states.yml)

The canonical states rarely need changing. If you add new states, update:
1. `templates/states.yml`
2. `normalize-statuses.mjs` (alias mappings)
3. `modes/_shared.md` (any references)
